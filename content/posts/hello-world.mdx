# Hello World

Welcome to my new blog! This is built with **Next.js** and **MDX**.

## Why MDX?

MDX allows you to write JSX in your Markdown files. This is powerful because:

1. You can use React components.
2. It's easy to write content.
3. It keeps the content and logic separate but accessible.

Here is a code snippet:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
